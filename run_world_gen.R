# This is a script showing gow the world_gen function should be run. Replace below where needed.

# First, set your working directory.  Additional files world_gen makes will be located here (typepars, cf_maps)
# Set the path below to that directory:
setwd("~/Documents/examplefolder")

# Next, choose your method of GIS. (GRASS GIS is currently the only method.)
GIStype = "GRASS"

# Set your GRASS GIS environment using the variables listed below.

# Your gisbase is the location of GRASS GIS on your system, typically:
gisbase = "/Applications/GRASS-6.4.app/Contents/MacOS"

# Home is the directory where a gisrc file will be created. This can be any directory and doesn't matter.
home = "~/Documents"

# Your gisdb is the location of your GRASS GIS database - ie the folder that contains your GRASS GIS projects
gisdb = "~/Documents/mygrassgisprojects"

# Your location is the name of your GRASS GIS location of interest
location = "MyGRASSGISlocation"

# Lastly, indicate your mapset in your GRASS GIS location.  By default this is "PERMANENT".
mapset = "PERMANENT"

# These GIS environment variables are combined into a vector, and removed.
typepars = c(gisbase,home,gisdb,location,mapset)
remove(gisbase,home,gisdb,location,mapset)

# template is the path and name of your template file.
template = "/templates/example.template"

# worldfile is the path and name of your worldfile
worldfile = "/worldfile/exmaple.world"

# overwrite is a TRUE/FALSE indicating if you want to overwrite an existing worldfile.
overwrite = FALSE

# Finally, run the function.  It may take a minute or two.
world_gen(template,worldfile,type,typepars,overwrite)
